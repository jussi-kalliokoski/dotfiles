# My workflow

These are the settings I use for my daily things. I put them up here because I juggle between a lot of computers and VPSes, and this provides me an easy way to get myself setup quickly.

## Setup

First, make sure that the current user has rights to ``` $PREFIX/bin ``` (usually /usr/local/bin):

```sh
# chown -R `whoami` /usr/local/bin
```

Then, install:

```sh
$ curl https://raw.github.com/jussi-kalliokoski/dotfiles/master/install.sh | bash
```

## Disclaimer

The vim plugins included here, not mine, don't blame me if they break your stuff. If my stuff breaks your stuff, don't blame me anyway, I'm stating here that these you shouldn't apply these things unless you know what they do and really want them, so the joke's on you.

## Permissions
For the stuff I wrote, it's licensed IDKIDC license, so do whatever you want, for other people's stuff, ask them. If you have ideas that would fit my workflow, by all means, share the love.
